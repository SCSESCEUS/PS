    <ul>
        <li>Spent 30 hours per week providing tutoring services to 3 students who were preparing for AP computer science exams. Both JAVA and English were covered.</li>
        <li>2 of them had no prior programming experiences, the other student learned some basic BASIC from school (about 4 hours of exposure to Microsoft Visual BASIC). All 3 of them scored 5 in the following AP CS exam. </li>
        <li>I continued giving them support over the internet even after all the tutoring sessions were over until they passed their exams.</li>

    <h4>
        Rubik’s Cube Instructor, <br/>
        Self-employed,<br/>

    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Spent 4 hours per week teaching a total of 16 students ranging from 2nd graders to 10th graders how to solve Rubik’s Cubes.</li>
        <li>I charge my students before each lesson starts for the previous lesson, and the fee for the last lesson is voluntary after the class ends. This means that they come to my class ONLY if they think the previous lesson was useful and worth the money. I do this with all my other tutoring students as well, no matter the subject. I never had any students in any of my classes drop out halfway and they all paid for their final lessons.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>SElECTED PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <h4>
        The Legend of One, <br/>
        February 2023 – Present
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A pixel art RPG game. It uses Unity as its game engine thus C# for its programming. The story takes place in an imaginary land called Caeluritus Continent, where magic, charms, martial arts, herbology and alchemy are common senses. It would be deeply connected with ancient Chinese mythology.</li>
        <li>I’m responsible for the main mechanism design and development of the game. It is very complex and complicated with all the different yet connected systems of the game play. I use Unity and its API’s to realize the design of the game. I also learned C# myself in advance in order to proficiently use the Unity game engine.</li>
    </ul>

        April 2022 – June 2022
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a React Web App that motivates the user to practice typing by rewarding the user pieces to a puzzle each time they finish a typing exercise. Please go to TYPuzzler.github.io if you would like to try it!</li>
        <li>I was responsible for the backend in our 4-person team. I implemented the puzzle (image) processing functionalities, the rewards system as well as a Flask server with a database attached. I had no prior programming experience with either Python or SQL which were used extensively in this project. Python was then used in another AI class in which I received a 3.8 and I also took a database management class later in which I received a 4.0.</li>

    <h4>
        Home Server, <br/>
        August 2016 – October 2018
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a Raspberry Pi based Linux home server that I built for my own convenience. It was mainly for VPN as well as testing remote JAVA software access. It also served as a media server after I upgraded the storage solution.</li>
        <li>I built this server from ground up with a Raspberry Pi (along with some other electronic components) that I purchased online and a 3D printer. I used Ubuntu as the OS as well as Docker/Protainer as my package/container manager. Some of my friends and family enjoyed about two years of free, fast and secure.</li>
        <li>I sold the whole unit (after clearing my personal information and restoring all its configurations to default) for more than what I paid for the Pi after two years of use.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Campus Map, <br/>
        September 2017 – December 2017
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>This is JAVA software I built as a class project. It’s a map of University of Washington Seattle campus and it gives the user shortest paths from one selected location to another on campus.</li>
        <li>The software uses Swing as its GUI system which makes the software consistent over different platforms. It uses basic ideas in software engineering such as modularity, defensive programming, MVC design pattern, event-driven programming and so on. It also uses several different search algorithms such as Dijkstra and A* for optimized user experience.</li>
